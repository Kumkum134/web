Bioenhancer and Metabolic activator technology enhances the passive diffusion and active transport mechanism through intestinal microvilli to improve Withanolides, Withaferin A and Withanosides absorption as well prevents it’s metabolic reduction through inhibition of P-gp efflux pump, CYP3AG and UGT.", segment: "Human OTC",
