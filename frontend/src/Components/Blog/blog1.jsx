              HOW TO IMPROVE EARLY LACTATION PERFORMANCE FOR HIGHER PEAK MILK YIELD?

              Successfully guiding cows through early lactation is key to their health and performance. Thus, nutrition and health during early lactation greatly affect peak milk yields. Preventing health problems and having good feed practices can improve peak milk yields.

                  Research shows dry period nutrition and management affects health and performance after birth. Thus, evaluate your dry cow program if youâ€™re unhappy with milk cow performance. Key goals for dry cows include:

                  Reduce the risk of subclinical milk fever (low blood calcium) during the first week of lactation. Low blood calcium (less than 8.0 milligrams deciliter) correlates with the following.

                  <li>To optimize cow comfort in the fresh cow group:</li>
                  <li>Use a stocking rate at 80 to 85 percent of capacity.</li>
                  <li>Keep cows in a fresh cow group for 14 to 21 days.</li>
                  <li>Provide 30 to 36 inches of bunk space per cow.</li>
                  <li>Reduce social stress (especially for first calf heifers).</li>

                  <li>Provide a flake of alfalfa/grass hay for the first five days after calving. Early lactation diet should contain plenty of good quality digestible fiber (31 to 35 percent neutral detergent fiber).</li>
                  <li>Maintain fiber mat with consistent feed intake and avoid empty bunks.</li>
                  <li>Provide free choice buffer, and monitor buffer intake.</li>

                  <li>Cows with a history of milk fever, ketosis or mastitis are likely to face these problems again. Keeping an eye on cows prone to health problems allows you to help prevent these problems.</li>
                  <li>For example, move cows carrying twins or first-calf heifers into the dry group early. Data shows a correlation with a 7- to 10- day earlier calving date.</li>

                  <li>The target BCS at calving is 3.0-3.25. You should avoid having cows reach a BCS greater than 4. A lower BCS at calving allows for 0.5 to 1.0 units of BCS within-herd variation. This provides a safety margin to avoid overweight cows that:</li>
                  <li>Have a higher risk for ketosis and fatty liver</li>
                  <li>Are often more difficult to breed back</li>

                  <li>Ionophores increase glucose availability.</li>
                  <li>Rumen-protected choline improves liver health and function.</li>
                  <li>Protected amino acids meet amino acid requirements without overfeeding protein.</li>
                  <li>Supplemental protected fat increases energy intake.</li>

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Anti-nutritional factors include feeds containing mold, wild yeast and poorly fermented feeds. Mold counts over 100,000 colonies per gram likely decrease feed intake and diet digestibility.

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Antioxidants (for example, vitamin E and selenium) help reduce the impact of oxidative stress. Oxidative stress could be too much fat mobilization, poor air quality or injury. These all decrease the efficiency of immune system function.
