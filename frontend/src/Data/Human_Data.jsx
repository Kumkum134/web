Potentiated phospholipid complex acts as carrier mediated transport system, which directs the Curcumin to reach the systemic circulation and also increases it’s absorption and bioavailability. Bioenhancer and Metabolic potentiator technology enhances the permeability of intestinal microvilli and improves Curcumin absorption as well as prevents it’s metabolic reduction through inhibition of P-gp, CYP3AG and UGT.",
