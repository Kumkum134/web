Yeco Nanophosphosome (Lutein-Zeaxanthin Nanophosphosome) easily crosses the gut barrier resulting in significantly higher blood levels of lutein and zeaxanthin. potentiated phospholipid complex acts as carrier mediated transport system, which directs lutein and zeaxanthin to reach the systemic circulation with enhanced bioavailability. Bioenhancer and metabolic potentiator technology enhances the permeability of intestinal microvilli and improves absorption as well prevents it’s metabolic reduction through invention of P-gp, CYP3AG and UGT Yeco Nanophosphosome provides consistent and uniform color for egg yolk, broiler skin and improves health and immunity.",
