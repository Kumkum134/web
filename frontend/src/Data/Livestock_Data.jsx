      "Auriliv vet is an advance liver tonic fortified with L-Carnitine and Cynarin extract to support liver health and reduce the risk of liver conditions like fatty liver syndrome. L-Carnitine plays a key role in maintaining liver function due to its effect on lipid metabolism. It transports fatty acids into mitochondria for oxidation and also buffers excess acetyl CoA away from mitochondria. Cynarin extract have hepato-protective effects. It inhibits the biosynthesis of hepato-cholesterol and improves the bile secretion. Choline acts as a lipotrophic substance. Choline and Methionine deficiency increases the risk of Fatty liver as their deficiency causes the synthesis of very-low-density-lipoproteins (VLDL).",
